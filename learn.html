        <h2>About the plots</h2>
        <p><a href="./index.html">The Prior Distribution</a> is a web tool for creating graphs of posttest probability vs. pretest probability. These graphs are called leaf plots and can be used to evaluate the utility of diagnostic tests.<sup><a href="./about.html">1</a></sup></p>

        <h3>Leaf plots depend only on sensitivity and specifity</h3>
        <p>When interpreting a diagnostic test, clinicians are interested in the positive or negative predictive value - the likelihood of the diagnosis given that the test is positive or negative, respectievly. However, positive and negative predictive values depend on pretest probability and will change when the test is used in different populations with different pretest probabilities. Leaf plots include all possible pretest probabilities and all corresponding posttest probabilities.
        <h3>How to read a leaf plot</h3>
        <p>Leaf plots are graphs of posttest probability (the y-axis) vs. pretest probability (the x-axis). They contain two curves: one for positive predictive value and one for negative predictive value. When the pretest probability is known, these curves give the posttest probability for a positive or negative test result, respectively.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, the pretest probability is not known. In this case, the shape of the leaf plot can give information about the utility of a test. Consider four different tests for pulmonary embolism (PE):</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>CT pulmonary angiography (high sensitivity and high specificity):</b> Tests with high sensitivity and high specificity have leaf plots with broad leaves. These test are useful for both ruling out and ruling in diagnoses. Below is a leaf plot for CT pulmonary angiography for diagnosis of PE with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%:<sup><a href="./about.html">2</a></sup></li>
            <div class="graph1"></div>

            <li><b>Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC; high sensitivity and low specificity):</b> Tests with high sensitivity and low specificity have leaf plots with broad lower portions and narrow upper portions. These tests are useful for ruling out diagnoses, but not for ruling them in. Below is a leaf plot for the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 21.9%:<sup><a href="./about.html">3</a></sup></li> 
            <div class="graph2"></div>

            <li><b>Transthoracic echocardiogram (low sensitivity and high specificity):</b> Tests with low sensitivity and high specificity have leaf plots with narrow lower portions and broad upper portions. These tests are not useful for ruling out diagnoses, but they are useful for ruling them in. Below is a leaf plot for transthoracic echocardiogram for diagnosis of PE, with a sensitivity of 41% and a specificity of 91%:<sup><a href="./about.html">4</a></sup></li>
            <div class="graph3"></div>

            <li><b>Pleural effusion on chest radiograph (low sensitivity and low specificity):</b> A chest radiograph is not a good test for pulmonary embolism and will serve as an example of a test with low sensitivity and low specificity. Such tests have leaf plots with narrow leaves. These tests are not useful for ruling out or ruling in diagnoses. Below is a leaf plot for pleural effusion on chest radiograph for the diagnosis of PE, with a sensitivity of 35% and a specificity of 70%:<sup><a href="./about.html">5</a></sup></li>
            <div class="graph4"></div>
        </ol>


        <h3>Limits of pretest probability</h3>
        <p>Leaf plots are also useful in visualizing very high or very low pretest probabilities. When pretest probability is very low, near 0%, posttest probability is also low.</p>
